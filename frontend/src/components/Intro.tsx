      You have a tough job Matt. You do it well but it's a tough job. To make it
      a little easier, here is a community-powered pronunciation guide to help
      you with those pesky foreign names... Hoink! ü´∂

          First of all, thank you, you smart, kind, and attractive person! üôè

        <p>
          Feel free to add recordings of athletes' names but please only do so
          if you are fluent in the language of the given athlete's country of
          origin. Recordings are limited to 5 seconds. Please speak slowly and
          clearly when recording. If there already is a good recording, you
          don't need to add your own. Unless you're the athlete in question, in
          which case, please do! ü§ó
        </p>
        <p>
          You can rate others' recordings. If you think a recording is not a
          good guide or it is an inappropriate submission, please vote it down.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the funny folks out there, please don't troll or abuse the app.
          I'm just some guy running this on my home server and don't have the
          resources to deal with any of that, so play nice please.
        </p>
