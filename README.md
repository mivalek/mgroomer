# The Matt Groomer üßó

Community-powered pronunciation guide for IFSC athletes

## Motivation

I like watching [IFSC](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/) competitions. Climbing is a great sport, the comps are exciting, and the commentary is good. However, [Matt Groom](https://www.instagram.com/mattgroom1/?hl=en), the commentator (as of 2025) sometimes understandably struggles with pronouncing non-anglophone names of athletes. This app is intended to provide a repository of pronunciation guide audio recordings to help him out. Contributions are very welcome!

## üöÄ Quick start (Docker)

The easiest way to get your own version of this app running is with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) compose:

1. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mivalek/mgroomer.git
    cd mgroomer
    ```

1. Configure your environment

    Copy and edit the sample environment file.

    ```
    cp .env.local.sample .env.local
    ```

1. Build and run the containers

    This command will build the images and start all the services (frontend, backend, file server, mariadb database, and nginx  ).

    ```
    docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build
    ```

1. You're ready!

    Open the app in your browser: http://localhost
